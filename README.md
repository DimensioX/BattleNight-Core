# BattleNight

BattleNight is a Player vs Player CraftBukkit plugin which makes the normal PvP experience a lot more enjoyable by adding RPG like classes and a arena. It was derived from a fantastic plugin called Fight by Deminetix as it had become inactive.

This branch is where the recode WIP is stored.
